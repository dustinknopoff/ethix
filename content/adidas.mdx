Adidas is owned by Adidas Group.

Its environmental rating is 'good'. It uses a medium proportion of eco-friendly materials including recycled materials. It has made a public commitment to reduce its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in absolute terms by 15% by 2020. It is a founding member of the Better Cotton Initiative, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and is partially certified by Bluesign. It traces whether its suppliers are operating in water-stressed basins and implements water reduction initiatives on those facilities.

Its labour rating is 'good' based on the 2018 Ethical Fashion Report. It has a Code of Conduct that covers all of the ILO principles. It traces most of its supply chain including all of the final and second stages of production. It audits most of its traced facilities. Only some of its facilities have worker empowerment initiatives such as collective bargaining or rights to make a complaint. It has made little to no progress towards paying ensuring payment of a living wage in its supply chain.

Its animal rating is 'it's a start'. It uses down and leather. It uses wool from non-mulesed sheep. It does not use angora, fur or any exotic animal skin or hair.
